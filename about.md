title: About me 
---

Started in 2013 part-time at a small web dev shop. Transitioned to an old-school ERP company for a couple years. Got a chance to work on [GitKraken](gitkraken.com) for a while, that was cool. Fast forward a bit longer and I took a job at AWS in Bellevue working on some data center tech. Decided to relocate back to Phoenix after a year to work on Coupons where I developed as a leader.

In 2021 was the VP of Engineering at [Nurture Boss](nurtureboss.io) where I learned a lot more about what it takes to run a startup. Eventually, I decided
that it made more sense to go back to Amazon, where I am now.
