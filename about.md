title: About me 
---

Started in 2013 part-time at a small web dev shop. Transitioned to an old-school ERP company for a couple years. Got a chance to work on [GitKraken](gitkraken.com) for a while, that was cool.

Fast forward a bit longer and I took a job at AWS in Bellevue working on some data center tech. That was chill. Came back to Phoenix after a year to work on Coupons (shoutout to SPARX) where I developed as a leader.

Now, I'm the VP of Engineering at [Nurture Boss](nurtureboss.io) working to bring Multifamily (apartments) into the future.
