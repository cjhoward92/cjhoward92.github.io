Ah, cost cutting. The answer to any company’s financial woes. I have a new business hack for any would-be CEOs out there - cut costs to zero and you suddenly have infinite revenue. Take that, Wall Street! Jokes aside, when a company changes course to prioritize cost cutting over revenue growth they blast a signal out into the cosmos: they have nowhere else to go. Businesses should be fiscally responsible, don’t get me wrong. I’m not advocating that companies completely ignore costs. I’m saying that cutting costs isn’t a business strategy.

The ultimate cost cutting signal is a layoff. A layoff should only occur for a few legitimate reasons, none of them good. For example, the business is dying. It might have lost market share to a superior competitor or some disruptive technology has completely subjugated the industry. Irresponsible hiring is not a legitimate reason for a layoff. If a company hired so irresponsibly that it could not survive unless there was a layoff the first person to be laid off better be the CEO and any other executive that supported the hiring. If a company chooses to layoff workers just to prop up the bottom line, well, the CEO should probably go then, too. Alas, this doesn’t happen, as witnessed in the last year or so of layoffs.
