Generics aren't daunting because of what they are but because of how complicated they get. Breaking them into concrete implementations and renaming type variables can help.

## What are they?

A generic type is one that allows a developer to build general functionality not bound to a specific type. The generic defines what other types can be used with it. Here is an example of a simple collection generic:

{% highlight typescript %}
// <T> signals that this type is generic. It's called the type variable.
class Collection<T> {

  private items: Array<T> = [];

  constructor() {}

  getAt(index: number): T {
    return this.items[index];
  }
  add(item: T): void {
    this.items.push(item);
  }
  removeAt(index: number): void {
    this.items = this.items.splice(index, 0);
  }
  count(): number {
    return this.items.length;
  }
}
{% endhighlight %}

## Why are they hard?

I think the "difficulty" in generics comes from bad type variable naming or overly complex types. You usually see type variables names `T` or `U` (like in my example above). Would you name a regular variable `T`? No, you wouldn't. So why name a type variable that way?

{% highlight typescript %}
class Collection<TCollectedType> {

  private items: Array<TCollectedType> = [];

  constructor() {}

  getAt(index: number): TCollectedType {
    return this.items[index];
  }
  add(item: TCollectedType): void {
    this.items.push(item);
  }
  removeAt(index: number): void {
    this.items = this.items.splice(index, 0);
  }
  count(): number {
    return this.items.length;
  }
}
{% endhighlight %}

`TCollectedType` is more explicit. It adds context to the `T` type variable: something collectable.

Here is how we use of the above type with the `TCollectedType` as `string`:

{% highlight typescript %}
const stringCollection = new Collection<string>();
{% endhighlight %}

Here is a more complex generic:

{% highlight typescript %}
type Action<T1, T2, T3, T4, T5, T6> = (t1: T1, t2: T2, t3: T3, t4: T4, t5: T5, t6: T6) => void;

const func: Action<string, number, string, number, string, number> = (s1: string, n1: number, s2: string, n2: number, s3: string, n3: number) => {
  console.log(s1, n1, s2, n2, s3, n3);
};
{% endhighlight %}

[Real example in C#](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/api/system.action-16?view=net-5.0). This represents a function with 6 parameters that are different types. The naming is poor as each param is just `Tn`. Better naming might help (e.g. `TFirstParamter, TSecondParamter`) at least to understand what's happening. I think in this example refactoring to a type with more context makes sense:

{% highlight typescript %}
type Action<TOptions> = (options: TOptions) => void;

type ManyOptions = {
  FirstArg: string;
  SecondArg: number;
  // ... etc
};

const func: Action<ManyOptions> = (options: ManyOptions) => {
  console.log(options);
};
{% endhighlight %}

I find it easier to understand a single type of `ManyOptions` vs six different, unrelated, types.

## Why do we use generics?

Mostly to save code. You don't need to change the collection code when you change the type of `TCollectedType`. A string-only collection looks like:

{% highlight typescript %}
class Collection {

  private items: Array<string> = [];

  constructor() {}

  getAt(index: number): string {
    return this.items[index];
  }
  add(item: string): void {
    this.items.push(item);
  }
  removeAt(index: number): void {
    this.items = this.items.splice(index, 0);
  }
  count(): number {
    return this.items.length;
  }
}
{% endhighlight %}

It's clear that code isn't specific to strings. Generics can share code without re-implementing anything.

{% highlight typescript %}
const stringCollection = new Collection<string>();
const numberCollection = new Collection<number>();
const objectCollection = new Collection<Object>();
{% endhighlight %}
