I'm going to write a microblog. Each post will be under 300 words (excluding code). I will include code examples in multiple languages, eventually.

The point is to help me distill complex topics into simple examples not only for myself but anyone that stumbles upon this blog.

Forcing myself to keep posts short will force me to write very directed and (ideally) clear content.

Forcing myself to keep posts short will hopefully entice me to write more.

Bear with me, I hate working on UI. My tab switching might be a bit chunky at first.

Anyway, here we go.
